B) if (year \>= 1400\) { category \= "Renaissance"; } if (year \>= 400\) { category \= "Medieval"; }
C) if (year \< 1400\) { category \= "Other"; } else { category \= "Renaissance"; }
D) category \= "Renaissance"; if (year \< 1400\) category \= "Other";
E) None of the above.  

**Answer:** A

#### 7
In a nested if statement, when is the **inner** Boolean expression evaluated?
A) Only if the outer expression is false.
B) **Only if the outer expression is true.**
C) It is always evaluated first.) It is evaluated regardless of the outer condition.
E) Only if the entire program compiles without warnings.  

**Answer:** B

#### 8
Which of the following describes a **multi-way selection** (if-else-if)?
A) Every block whose condition is true will execute.
B) Only the else block is guaranteed to execute.
C) **No more than one segment of code is executed based on the first expression that evaluates to true.**
D) It is used to repeat code until a condition is met.
E) It is only used with String objects.  

**Answer:** C
