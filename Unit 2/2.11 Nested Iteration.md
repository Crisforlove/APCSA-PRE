#### 2
How many times will hello be printed?

j++;
}

#### 3
In a nested iteration, when does the **inner** loop finish all its iterations?

B) **Before the outer loop can continue to its next iteration.**
C) At the same time as the outer loop.
D) It only runs once regardless of the outer loop.
E) Only if a Boolean expression is false.  

**Answer:** B

#### 4
