### Topic 4.2 — Introduction to Using Data Sets

#### 1
Why use an **ArrayList** of Strings rather than an **Array** to read lines from a file of unknown length? 11
A) The get and set methods are more convenient than \[\].
B) The size method provides faster access than the length attribute.
C) An ArrayList can store any data type, whereas arrays only store primitives.
D) The ArrayList will automatically resize itself to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
E) String methods are natively faster in an ArrayList.
**Answer:** D

#### 2
Which is the best reason to use an **array of int** rather than an **ArrayList of Integer** for long numerical lists? 12
A) Primitive arrays are more memory-efficient and faster to manipulate than wrapper objects.
B) It is easier to code the insertion of new elements into the middle of an array.
C) Deleting elements from the middle is less complex with an array.
D) Arrays allow random access while ArrayLists only allow sequential access.
E) Arrays automatically sort themselves during initialization.
**Answer:** A

#### 3
What is the time complexity of calculating a sum using a loop that iterates up to a given bound? 13
A) The result is bound, and the time complexity is constant.
B) The execution time is linear (O(n)) relative to the input bound.
C) The result is always zero because the loop never executes.
D) The loop results in an ArithmeticException if the bound is negative.
E) The complexity is quadratic because it uses a nested loop.
**Answer:** B

#### 4
In a class constructor, which code correctly initializes an array tickList of Ticket objects? 14
A) tickList\[i\] \= new Ticket(getRow(), getSeat(), getPrice());
B) tickList\[i\] \= new Ticket(theRow, theSeat, thePrice);
C) tickList\[i\] \= new tickList(getRow(), getSeat(), getPrice());
D) tickList\[i\] \= new tickList(theRow, theSeat, thePrice);
E) tickList\[i\] \= new tickList(numTicks);
**Answer:** B

#### 5
Which code segment represents a correct implementation for calculating a sum in a totalPaid method? 14
A) An enhanced for loop that directly accesses the private price field.
B) An enhanced for loop that calls tickList.getPrice().
C) An enhanced for loop that calls t.getPrice() where t is a Ticket object.
D) A standard for loop that iterates through a Transaction object T.
E) A while loop that attempts to access t.price without a getter.
**Answer:** C

#### 6
A programmer is writing a loop to find the minimum value. How can they avoid skipping the last element? 15
A) Changing the starting index from 1 to 0\.
B) Adjusting the loop body so comparison happens before the index increment.
C) Changing the loop condition to use \<= with the array length.
D) Initializing the minimum variable to 0 before the loop.
E) Using a do-while loop instead of a while loop.
**Answer:** B

#### 7
Given ArrayList strList, which of the following will cause a compiler error? 16
A) strList.add(ch); (where ch is a character)
B) strList.add("handy andy");
C) strList.add(intOb.toString());
D) strList.add(ch \+ 8); (where the result is a String)
E) strList.add(intOb \+ 8); (where the result is an integer)
**Answer:** E

#### 8
Given a list containing 6 elements (indices 0 to 5), which statement will **NOT** cause an error? 64
A) list.get(6);
B) list.add(3.4);
C) list.add(6, 9);
D) list.remove(6);
E) list.set(6, 8);
**Answer:** C

#### 9
A method insert adds an element into a sorted descending list. In which case will it fail? 64
A) It works for all possible values.
B) It fails if the element is already present.
C) It fails if the element is larger than the first item.
D) It fails if the element is smaller than the last item (causing out-of-bounds).
E) It fails if the list is empty.
**Answer:** D

#### 10
Which is a suitable declaration to keep a list of NUMSALES ticket transactions? 62
A) Transaction\[\] listOfSales \= new Transaction\[NUMSALES\];
B) Transaction\[\] listOfSales \= new Ticket\[NUMSALES\];
C) Ticket\[\] listOfSales \= new Transaction\[NUMSALES\];
D) Ticket\[\] listOfSales \= new Ticket\[NUMSALES\];
E) Transaction\[\] Ticket \= new listOfSales\[NUMSALES\];
**Answer:** A
