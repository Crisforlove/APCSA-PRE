### Topic 4.17 — Recursive Searching and Sorting
#### 1

B) Insertion Sort
C) **Merge Sort**
D) Binary Search
E) Linear Search
**Answer:** C

#### 2
**Binary Search** is typically more efficient than Linear Search because: 36
A) It works on unsorted lists.
B) It eliminates half of the remaining elements in each recursive call/iteration.
C) It uses more memory.
D) It is iterative only.
E) It only works on String objects.
**Answer:** B

#### 3
A recursive method doSomething(3) that calls itself twice per level results in which output sequence? 37
A) 3211211
B) 1121213
C) 1213121
D) 1211213
E) 1123211
**Answer:** C

#### 4
To use the **Binary Search** algorithm, the data MUST be: 36
A) Positive integers.
B) In sorted order.
C) Shorter than 100 elements.
D) Stored in a File object.
E) Immutable.
**Answer:** B

#### 5
What is the result of each step of the **Merge Sort** algorithm? 38
A) Elements are swapped into their final position immediately.
B) The array is repeatedly divided into smaller subarrays until they are single elements.
C) The smallest element is moved to the front.
D) The array is cleared and rebuilt.
E) A NullPointerException occurs.
**Answer:** B

#### 6
Which change in the recursive method writeWithCommas will fix an implementation that prints incorrectly? 39
A) Interchange the lines that print high digits and low digits.
B) Use Math.random().
C) Change the base case to n \> 1000\.
D) Use a while loop instead.
E) Cast the int to a double.
**Answer:** A

#### 7
The binary search algorithm can be written: 31
A) Only iteratively.
B) Only recursively.
C) Either iteratively or recursively.
D) Only as a static method.
E) Only in the main method.
**Answer:** C

#### 8
What is the return value of foo(foo(3) \+ foo(4)) if foo(n) calculates $n\!$? 40
A) 15
B) (15\!)/(2\!)
C) (7\!)\!
D) (3\! \+ 4\!)\!
E) 120
**Answer:** D

#### 9
Recursion can be used to traverse which data collections? 41
A) String objects
B) Array objects
C) ArrayList objects
D) All of the above
E) None of the above
**Answer:** D

#### 10
In a recursive binary search, if the target is **not found**: 36
A) The program crashes.
B) The method returns \-1 (or a similar indicator) once the search interval is empty.
C) The method enters an infinite loop.
D) The array is automatically sorted.
E) A FileNotFoundException is thrown.
**Answer:** B
