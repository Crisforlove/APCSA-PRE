B) Pre-checking a consent box and allowing the user to continue automatically.
C) Showing a clear prompt describing specific data types and their purpose, requiring the user to tap "Agree".

#### 2
An attendance application only requires a student's name and ID number to function. Which approach is most consistent with **data minimization**? 2
A) Collecting the student's home address and GPA for "future analytics."
B) Requiring a birth date to verify age for legal compliance regardless of need.

D) Storing only the name and ID; leaving all other fields optional and off by default.
E) Denying access to the app unless a verified phone number is provided.
**Answer:** D

#### 3
Why might a hiring algorithm that uses a data set of past successful employees produce **biased predictions**? 3
A) Old data sets are always too small to be statistically significant.
B) Past human decisions may encode historical biases that the algorithm then repeats.
C) Sorting training data alphabetically removes all inherent bias from the set.
D) Random shuffling of the data set deletes any systemic bias.
E) Bias in programs only stems from incorrect Java code, never from data.
**Answer:** B

#### 4
What is the best immediate mitigation after detecting unauthorized access to a database containing student records? 4
A) Delete all existing backups to prevent further exposure.
B) Publicly release all records to ensure maximum transparency.
C) Rotate all credentials, lock down access points, and review audit logs.
D) Disable all encryption protocols to simplify the forensic investigation.
E) Ignore the breach unless it is confirmed that grades were specifically changed.
**Answer:** C

#### 5
A fitness tracking app shares raw heart-rate data with third-party advertisers. What is the primary **ethical issue**? 5
A) The data are too noisy to be useful for any commercial purpose.
B) Heart-rate data are already anonymized by default by the sensor.
C) Secondary use of sensitive health data without explicit consent violates user expectations.
D) Heart-rate data are not considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
E) Advertisers are legally required to aggregate all data safely before use.
**Answer:** C

#### 6
A company's policy states that server logs are deleted after 30 days, but a developer keeps them for a year. What is the main risk? 6
A) No risk exists if the servers have enough storage capacity.
B) It violates the retention policy and expands the impact surface of a potential breach.
C) It only affects system performance and has no impact on user privacy.
D) It improves model accuracy so it is an acceptable trade-off.
E) Disk encryption removes all ethical risks associated with data retention.
**Answer:** B

#### 7
Why can simply "removing names" from a data set (de-identification) sometimes fail to protect user identity? 7
A) The resulting file size stays too large for secure transmission.
B) Quasi-identifiers like age and zip code can be linked to other public sets to re-identify individuals.
C) Hashing algorithms always reveal the original identity through a simple reverse search.
D) Only photographic data can be used to re-identify individuals.
E) Data without names are mathematically impossible to link to other sources.
**Answer:** B

#### 8
A survey application only collects responses from "Premium" users. What type of **bias** does this risk? 8
A) No risk, because premium users represent the most important part of the user base.
B) Sampling bias, as the results skew toward high-activity users, making conclusions invalid for all.
C) Accuracy bias, because fewer samples are more accurate.
D) No bias occurs as long as the questions are written objectively.
E) Bias only occurs in offline physical data sets.
**Answer:** B

#### 9
Which measure is most appropriate for protecting **sensitive data at rest** (e.g., student grades on a disk)? 9
A) Storing the data in plain text to allow for easier debugging.
B) Using weak encryption to ensure no performance loss during access.
C) Implementing strict access controls and encrypting the physical disk or files.
D) Relying solely on a network firewall to prevent access to the storage device.
E) Making multiple copies on personal devices to ensure data is never lost.
**Answer:** C

#### 10
If a programmer collects email addresses for "notifications" but later wants to sell them to advertisers, they should: 10
A) Sell the list immediately to maximize company revenue.
B) Send a notification email that doesn't provide a way to opt-out.
C) Obtain explicit opt-in consent for the new purpose or refrain from the secondary use.
D) Proceed because the data were already legally collected.
E) Sell the data as long as it is stored in an encrypted format during transfer.
**Answer:** C
