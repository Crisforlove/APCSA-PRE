```java
What would the array {89, 42, \-3, 13, 109, 70, 2} look like after the **third pass** of a selection sort (sorting high to low)? 30
```

D) Constant time algorithms.
E) Random number generators.
**Answer:** B

#### 5
A sorting algorithm is considered **stable** if: 30
A) It uses no extra memory.
B) It preserves the relative order of elements with equal values.
C) It always takes $O(n^2)$ time.
D) it can only sort integers.

#### 6
Which algorithm is generally more efficient for sorting **long, randomly ordered** lists in the AP CSA curriculum? 31
A) Selection Sort
B) Insertion Sort
C) Merge Sort
D) Linear Search
E) Binary Search
**Answer:** C

#### 7
Insertion sort is most efficient when: 30
A) The array is already sorted or nearly sorted.
B) The array is sorted in reverse order.
C) The array is completely random.
D) The array contains only zeros.
E) The array size is over 1 million.
**Answer:** A

#### 8
Selection sort is preferred over insertion sort when: 32
A) Comparisons are expensive but swaps are cheap.
B) **Swaps are expensive** (as it performs at most $n-1$ swaps).
C) The list is already sorted.
D) You need a recursive solution.
E) The array is an ArrayList.
**Answer:** B

#### 9
In **Selection Sort**, the number of **comparisons** is always: 29
A) Constant.
B) $O(n)$.
C) $O(n^2)$.
D) $O(\\log n)$.
E) Zero.
**Answer:** C

B) Half the list per iteration.
C) Random increments. ) Only if the element is smaller than the mean.
E) Converting the array to a String.
**Answer:** A
