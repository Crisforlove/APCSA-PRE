C) Binary search.
D) Sorting the 2D array.
E) Recursive character counting.
**Answer:** B

#### 2
To determine if **duplicate elements** exist in a subsection of a 2D array, which approach is required? 22
A) Using Math.random().
B) Nested iteration statements comparing elements within that subsection.
C) A single if-else statement.
D) Calling arr.length.
E) Casting the array to a Double.
**Answer:** B

#### 3
What does the following code segment do? (Assuming a square matrix mat and a swap method). 23
A) Reflects mat through its major diagonal.
B) Reflects mat through its **minor (副) diagonal**.
C) Reflects mat through a horizontal line.
D) Reflects mat through a vertical line.
E) Leaves mat unchanged.
**Answer:** B

#### 4
The method alter is intended to **remove column c**. Which change will correct a buggy implementation? 24 I. Change the loop limit to mat.length \- 1\. II. Shift elements to the left by assigning mat\[i\]\[j\] \= mat\[i\]\[j+1\]. III. Both of the above are valid steps in the correction.
A) I only
B) II only
C) III only
D) I and II only
E) I, II, and III
**Answer:** E

#### 5
A method isThere(mat, r, c, target) returns true if a specific condition is met. Which condition guarantees a true result if the logic checks rows/columns? 24
A) Only the target cell matches.
B) All elements in the specified column match.
C) All elements in the specified row match.
D) Both B and C are possible depending on implementation.
E) The matrix must be sorted.
**Answer:** D

#### 6
Standard 2D algorithms can determine a minimum or maximum value: 21
A) Only for the entire array.
B) Only for the first row.
C) For the entire array OR a designated row/column/subsection.
D) Only if the elements are String objects.
E) Using a single while loop.
**Answer:** C

#### 7
Which algorithm correctly **reverses the order** of elements in a row? 22
A) Sorting the row.
B) Swapping elements in that row from left and right ends.
C) Replacing the row with the first column.
D) Multiplying all elements by \-1.
E) Casting the row to a boolean.
**Answer:** B

#### 8
To **shift or rotate** elements in a column up or down, the algorithm must: 22
A) Traverse the rows while keeping the column index constant.
B) Traverse the columns while keeping the row index constant.
C) Use the substring() method.
D) Clear the entire 2D array.
E) Call Math.random().
**Answer:** A

#### 9
Determining if **all elements** in a designated subsection have a particular property requires: 21
A) A single comparison.
B) A traversal with a boolean "flag" that remains true only if every element meets the criteria.
C) A NullPointerException.
D) A static factory method.
E) An enhanced for loop that returns false at the first element. (Note: It must check all until failure).
**Answer:** B

#### 10
Calculating the **average** of a designated column involves: 21
A) Summing the entire matrix and dividing by size.
B) Summing the elements in that column and dividing by the number of rows.
C) Summing the first row.
D) Using Math.pow().
E) Dividing the first element by the last.
**Answer:** B
