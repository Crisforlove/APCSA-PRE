### Topic 4.10 — Implementing ArrayList Algorithms
#### 1
A "compression" algorithm for an ArrayList moves only non-zero elements into a new list. If the original list is \[6-8\], what is the result? 9
A) \[6-8\]
B) \[6-8\]
C) \[6-8\]
D) \[6-8\]
E) \[6-8\]
**Answer:** A

#### 2
Which of the following is a standard ArrayList algorithm to determine the presence of duplicate elements? 10
A) Sorting and checking the first element.
B) Using a single loop to sum all elements.
C) Using nested traversals or a secondary storage to compare elements.
D) Calling list.size().
E) Using the Math.random() method.
**Answer:** C

#### 3
To find the **minimum** or **maximum** value in an ArrayList, you should: 10
A) Sort the list and return the middle element.
B) Traverse the list while maintaining a variable that stores the smallest/largest value seen so far.
C) Use the Integer.MAX\_VALUE constant to clear the list.
D) Use a while loop that only checks the last element.
E) Convert the list to a String and count characters.
**Answer:** B

#### 4
Which method is used to insert an element at a specific position index in an ArrayList, shifting subsequent elements to the right? 11
A) set(index, obj)
B) add(obj)
C) add(index, obj)
D) remove(index)
E) insert(index, obj)
**Answer:** C

#### 5
A standard algorithm to **reverse** the order of elements in an ArrayList can be implemented by: 10
A) Calling list.size() and adding 1 to each index.
B) Swapping elements from opposite ends of the list until the middle is reached.
C) Replacing all elements with null.
D) Using an enhanced for loop to print elements.
E) Adding a new element to the end of the list.
**Answer:** B

#### 6
What is the effect of calling list.remove(index)? 11
A) It replaces the element with 0\.
B) It removes the element and moves all elements to the right one position to the left.
C) It increases the size of the ArrayList.
D) It returns true if the element was removed.
E) It throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is size.
**Answer:** B

#### 7
Which algorithm involves accessing all **consecutive pairs** of elements? 10
A) Finding the average.
B) Reversing the list.
C) Checking for specific properties between neighbors (e.g., if the list is sorted).
D) Initializing the list with new ArrayList().
E) Converting an int to an Integer.
**Answer:** C

#### 8
Some algorithms require multiple ArrayList objects to be traversed **simultaneously**. An example is: 12
A) Summing elements in a single list.
B) Comparing elements at the same index in two different lists.
C) Finding the maximum value in one list.
D) Printing a single string.
E) Counting characters in a word.
**Answer:** B

#### 9
To compute the **average** of numerical values in an ArrayList, the algorithm must: 10
A) Find the maximum value and divide by 2\. ) Traverse the list to compute the sum, then divide by the total number of elements.
C) Multiply all elements together.
D) Return the value at index 0\.
E) Use the Math.sqrt() method on the list size.
**Answer:** B

#### 10
The standard algorithm to **shift or rotate** elements left or right typically requires: 10
A) A single if statement.
B) A traversal that moves elements to a new index or uses a temporary variable.
C) Setting the list to null.
D) Calling System.out.println.
E) Using a boolean variable.
**Answer:** B
