### Topic 4.14 — Searching Algorithms
#### 1
The decision to choose a particular searching or sorting algorithm should be based on: 25 I. Run-time efficiency. II. Size of the array. III. Space efficiency.
A) I only
B) II only
C) III only
D) I and II only
E) I, II, and III
**Answer:** E

#### 2
Which boolean expression should replace the placeholder in a **sequential search**? 25
A) value \!= a\[i\]
B) i \< n && value \== a\[i\]
C) value \!= a\[i\] && i \< n
D) i \< n && value \!= a\[i\]
E) i \< n || value \!= a\[i\]
**Answer:** D

#### 3
What feature is required for a **binary search** but not necessarily for a sequential search? 25
A) Length of list.
B) Type of data.
C) **Order of data (sorted).**
D) Smallest value.
E) Median value.
**Answer:** C

#### 4
For which operation is a **sorted array** more efficient than an unsorted one? 25 I. Inserting a new element. II. Searching for a given element. III. Computing the mean.
A) I only
B) II only
C) III only
D) I and II only
E) I, II, and III
**Answer:** B

#### 5
In what case does a "jump" search algorithm (comparing every third item) use **fewer** comparisons than a binary search? 25
A) Never.
B) When the target is in the middle.
C) When the target is very close to the **beginning** of the array.
D) When the target is very close to the end.
E) When the target is not in the array.
**Answer:** C

#### 6
If the assertion a \> a\[k\] for all $0 \< k \< N$ is true, what must be true? 25
A) The array is sorted ascending.
B) The array is sorted descending.
C) All values are different.
D) a is the smallest.
E) a is the **largest**.
**Answer:** E

#### 7
```java
A sequential search implementation while(a\[index\] \!= key) index++; will definitely fail if: 25
```
A) The key is the first element.
B) The key is the last element.
C) The key is **not in the array** (causing an index error).
D) The key equals 0\.
E) The key is an Integer object.
**Answer:** C

#### 8
If a search method contains while (v\[index\] \< key), what should be added to the **precondition**? 26
A) v is sorted smallest to largest.
B) v is sorted largest to smallest.
C) v is unsorted.
D) The key exists in v.
E) The key occurs only once.
**Answer:** A

#### 9
Linear search algorithms: 27
A) Must start from the middle.
B) Check each element in order until the desired value is found or all elements are checked.
C) Only work on int arrays.
D) Are more efficient than binary search for large sorted lists.
E) Always take constant time.
**Answer:** B

#### 10
When applying a linear search to a **2D array**: 28
A) You only need one loop.
B) Each row must be accessed, and then linear search is applied to each row.
C) The array must be sorted in column-major order.
D) It is impossible to find a value.
E) You must use Math.pow().
**Answer:** B
