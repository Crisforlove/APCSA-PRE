Answer: C

#### 10
What is the difference between `int[] b = a;` and `int[] b = Arrays.copyOf(a, a.length);`?

- A) Both create an identical new array in memory.
- B) The first creates an alias; the second creates a separate copy.
- C) The first creates a copy; the second creates an alias.
- D) Both cause a compiler error for primitive arrays.
- E) The second statement automatically doubles the size.

Answer: B
