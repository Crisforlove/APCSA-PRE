### Topic 4.15 — Sorting Algorithms

#### 1
Assume that selectionSort (ascending order) has been called with an int[] argument initialized with {40, 30, 50, 60, 10, 20}. What will the contents of the array be after **three iterations** of the outer loop (when $j == 2$)?

- A) {10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 50}
- B) {10, 20, 30, 60, 40, 50}
- C) {10, 20, 50, 60, 40, 30}
- D) {10, 30, 50, 60, 40, 20}
- E) {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}

Answer: B

#### 2
Which of the following should influence the choice of a particular sorting algorithm?

- I. Run-time efficiency of the sort
- II. Size of the array
- III. Space efficiency of the algorithm

- A) I only
- B) II only
- C) III only
- D) I and II only
- E) I, II, and III

Answer: E

#### 3
If an array contains 89 42 -3 13 109 70 2, what would the array look like after the **third pass** of selectionSort when sorting from **high to low**?

- A) 109 89 70 13 42 -3 2
- B) 109 89 70 42 13 2 -3
- C) 109 89 70 -3 2 13 42
- D) 89 42 13 -3 109 70 2
- E) 109 89 42 -3 13 70 2

Answer: B

#### 4
An array of Integer is to be sorted **biggest to smallest** using insertionSort. If the array contains 1 7 9 5 4 12, what will it look like after the **third pass** of the for loop?

- A) 9 7 1 5 4 12
- B) 9 7 5 1 4 12
- C) 12 9 7 1 5 4
- D) 12 9 7 5 4 1
- E) 9 7 12 5 4 1

Answer: A

#### 5
When sorting a long list of integers that is **roughly sorted** in decreasing order (no more than 5% out of order), which is a valid reason to use insertionSort rather than selectionSort?

- I. Fewer comparisons for insertion sort.
- II. Fewer changes of position for insertion sort.
- III. Less space required for insertion sort.

- A) I only
- B) II only
- C) III only
- D) I and II only
- E) I, II, and III

Answer: D

#### 6
Which of the following represents a **worst-case** situation for the insertionSort algorithm?

- I. A list in correct sorted order.
- II. A list sorted in reverse order.
- III. A list in random order.

- A) I only
- B) II only
- C) III only
- D) I and II only
- E) II and III only

Answer: B

#### 7
Why is **Merge Sort** generally considered a better algorithm than Insertion Sort for sorting long, randomly ordered lists?

- I. Merge sort requires less code.
- II. Merge sort requires less storage space.
- III. Merge sort runs faster.

- A) I only
- B) II only
- C) III only
- D) I and II only
- E) II and III only

Answer: C

#### 8
Which list will require the **greatest number of changes** in position when sorted biggest to smallest with insertionSort?

- A) 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 6, 9
- B) 9, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
- C) 9, 4, 6, 2, 1, 5, 1, 3
- D) 9, 6, 9, 5, 6, 7, 2, 0
- E) 3, 2, 1, 0, 9, 6, 5, 4

Answer: E

#### 9
Selection sort is characterized by which process?

- A) Dividing the array into single elements.
- B) Inserting elements into a sorted portion by shifting.
- C) Swapping the smallest remaining element into its final position.
- D) Using a sentinel to process word lists.
- E) Recursing until a base case of 0 is reached.

Answer: C

#### 10
When sorting a list **biggest to smallest** with insertionSort, which of the following will need the **fewest changes of position**?

- A) 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- B) 9, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2
- C) 9, 4, 2, 5, 1, 3
- D) 9, 3, 5, 1, 4, 2
- E) 3, 2, 1, 9, 5, 4

Answer: B
