### Topic 4.2 — Introduction to Using Data Sets

#### 1
When a program needs to read lines from a text file of unknown length, which is a primary reason to use an **ArrayList** rather than an **Array**?

- A) The get and set methods are more convenient than notation.
- B) The size method provides faster access to the length.
- C) An ArrayList can store any data type, whereas arrays only store primitives.
- D) The ArrayList will automatically resize itself if the file is longer than expected.
- E) String methods are natively faster when stored in an ArrayList.

Answer: D

#### 2
Which is the best reason to implement a long list of numerical data with an **array of int** rather than an **ArrayList of Integer**?

- A) An array of primitive types is more memory-efficient and faster to manipulate than an ArrayList of wrapper objects.
- B) It is easier to code the insertion of new elements into the middle of an array.
- C) Deleting elements from the middle of a list is less complex with an array.
- D) Arrays allow for random access to elements while ArrayLists only allow sequential access.
- E) Arrays automatically sort themselves during the initialization process.

Answer: A

#### 3
What is the time complexity of calculating a sum using a loop that iterates up to a given bound?

- A) The result is bound, and the time complexity is constant.
- B) The execution time is linear (O(n)) relative to the input bound.
- C) The result is always zero because the loop never executes.
- D) The loop will result in an ArithmeticException if the bound is negative.
- E) The complexity is quadratic because it uses a nested loop structure.

Answer: B

#### 4
In a Transaction class constructor, which code correctly initializes an array tickList of Ticket objects?

- A) tickList[i] = new Ticket(getRow(), getSeat(), getPrice());
- B) tickList[i] = new Ticket(theRow, theSeat, thePrice);
- C) tickList[i] = new tickList(getRow(), getSeat(), getPrice());
- D) tickList[i] = new tickList(theRow, theSeat, thePrice);
- E) tickList[i] = new tickList(numTicks);

Answer: B

#### 5
Which code segment represents a correct implementation for calculating the total amount paid in a totalPaid method?

- A) An enhanced for loop that directly accesses the private price field of a Ticket.
- B) An enhanced for loop that calls tickList.getPrice().
- C) An enhanced for loop that calls t.getPrice() where t is a Ticket object.
- D) A standard for loop that iterates through a Transaction object T.
- E) A while loop that attempts to access t.price without a getter.

Answer: C

#### 6
A programmer is writing a loop to find the minimum value. To avoid skipping the last element, which modification is effective?

- A) Changing the starting index from 1 to 0.
- B) Adjusting the loop body so the comparison happens before the index is incremented.
- C) Changing the loop condition to use the <= operator with the array length.
- D) Initializing the minimum variable to 0 before the loop starts.
- E) Using a do-while loop instead of a standard while loop.

Answer: B

#### 7
Given ArrayList strList, which of the following statements will cause a compiler error?

- A) strList.add(ch); (where ch is a char)
- B) strList.add("handy andy");
- C) strList.add(intOb.toString());
- D) strList.add(ch + 8); (where result is a String)
- E) strList.add(intOb + 8); (where result is an integer)

Answer: E

#### 8
Given a list containing 6 elements (indices 0 to 5), which statement will NOT cause an error?

- A) list.get(6);
- B) list.add(3.4);
- C) list.add(6, 9);
- D) list.remove(6);
- E) list.set(6, 8);

Answer: C

#### 9
A method insert adds an element into a sorted descending list. In which case will it fail?

- A) It works for all possible values.
- B) It fails if the element is already present.
- C) It fails if the element is larger than the first item.
- D) It fails if the element is smaller than the last item (causing out-of-bounds).
- E) It fails if the list is empty.

Answer: D

#### 10
Which is a suitable declaration to keep a list of NUMSALES ticket transactions?

- A) Transaction[] listOfSales = new Transaction[NUMSALES];
- B) Transaction[] listOfSales = new Ticket[NUMSALES];
- C) Ticket[] listOfSales = new Transaction[NUMSALES];
- D) Ticket[] listOfSales = new Ticket[NUMSALES];
- E) Transaction[] Ticket = new listOfSales[NUMSALES];

Answer: A
