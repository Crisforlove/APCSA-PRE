### Topic 4.10 — Implementing ArrayList Algorithms

#### 1
The averageWithinRange(10.0, 50.0) method is called on inventory [20.0 (T), 45.0 (T), 10.0 (T), 45.0 (F)]. What is returned?

- A) 20.0
- B) 25.0
- C) 30.0
- D) 37.33
- E) 45.0

Answer: B

#### 2
Which strategy determines if an ArrayList contains **duplicate** elements?

- A) A single loop to check the first element.
- B) Using nested traversals or secondary storage (like a Set) to compare all elements.
- C) Sorting and returning the middle element.
- D) Summing elements and checking the size.
- E) Converting the list to a String.

Answer: B

#### 3
Which method inserts an element at index, shifting subsequent elements to the right?

- A) set(index, obj)
- B) add(obj)
- C) add(index, obj)
- D) remove(index)
- E) insert(index, obj)

Answer: C

#### 4
A standard algorithm to **reverse** an ArrayList is implemented by:

- A) Calling list.size() and adding 1 to each index.
- B) Swapping elements from opposite ends until the middle is reached.
- C) Replacing all elements with null.
- D) Using an enhanced for loop to print.
- E) Adding a new element to the end.

Answer: B

#### 5
Which algorithm requires multiple ArrayList objects to be traversed **simultaneously**?

- A) Summing elements in a single list.
- B) Comparing elements at the same index in two different lists.
- C) Finding the maximum value in one list.
- D) Printing a single string.
- E) Counting characters in a word.

Answer: B

#### 6
Which algorithm involves accessing all **consecutive pairs** of elements?

- A) Finding the average.
- B) Reversing the list.
- C) Checking for specific properties between neighbors (e.g., if sorted).
- D) Initializing the list with new.
- E) Converting an int to Integer.

Answer: C

#### 7
To compute the **average** of numerical values, the algorithm must:

- A) Find the max and divide by 2.
- B) Traverse the list to compute the sum, then divide by total count.
- C) Multiply all elements.
- D) Return the value at index 0.
- E) Use Math.sqrt() on the size.

Answer: B

#### 8
The algorithm to **shift or rotate** elements typically requires:

- A) A single if statement.
- B) A traversal that moves elements to a new index or uses a temporary variable.
- C) Setting the list to null.
- D) Calling System.out.println.
- E) Using a boolean variable.

Answer: B

#### 9
In an algorithm to find the **maximum** value, what should the max variable be initialized to?

- A) 0
- B) Integer.MAX\_VALUE
- C) The first element of the list.
- D) The last element of the list.
- E) -1

Answer: C
