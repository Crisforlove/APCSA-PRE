- A) Each column is accessed from top to bottom before moving to the next.
- B) Each row is accessed from left to right sequentially.
- C) Elements are accessed in a random order to ensure data integrity.
- D) Only the diagonal elements where row index equals column index are accessed.
- E) Only the last row is accessed in reverse.

Answer: B

#### 2
Which of the following describes a **column-major order** traversal?

- A) Each row is accessed from left to right sequentially.
- B) Elements are accessed by going down each column from top to bottom.
- C) The array is converted to a 1D ArrayList before processing.

- E) Only the elements in the middle column are processed.

Answer: B

#### 3

- B) Integer
- C) int[] (a 1D array)
- D) Object
- E) boolean

Answer: C

#### 4
In a nested enhanced for loop traversing int[][] arr, what is the type of the **inner** loop variable?

- A) int[]
- B) int
- C) double
- D) String
- E) void

Answer: B

#### 5
During a 2D array traversal using an **enhanced for loop**, what happens if you assign a new value to the loop variable?

- A) The corresponding value in the original 2D array is updated.
- B) The value in the original 2D array remains unchanged.
- C) A ConcurrentModificationException is thrown.
- D) An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs.
- E) The traversal switches from row-major to column-major.

Answer: B

#### 6
In a row-major traversal of an $N \\times M$ array, how many times in total will the **inner** loop body execute?

- A) $N$ times
- B) $M$ times
- C) $N \\times M$ times
- D) $N + M$ times
- E) 1 time

Answer: C

#### 7
Which loop structure correctly performs a **column-major** traversal of int[][] mat?

- A) for (int r=0; r < mat.length; r++) followed by for (int c=0; c < mat[r].length; c++)
- B) for (int c=0; c < mat.length; c++) followed by for (int r=0; r < mat.length; r++)
- C) for (int[] row : mat)
- D) while (i < mat.length)
- E) for (int r=0; r < mat.length; r++) { process(mat[r]); }

Answer: B

#### 8
Given a square 2D array of size $N \\times N$, a nested loop traverses only the elements where the row index $r$ is equal to the column index $c$. How many elements are visited?

- A) $N^2$
- B) $N$
- C) $N/2$
- D) $N(N-1)$
- E) 1

Answer: B

#### 9
A programmer uses a nested loop to traverse a 2D array. The outer loop runs from $0$ to arr.length - 1 and the inner loop runs from $0$ to arr.length - 1. This is an example of:

- A) Binary Search traversal.
- B) Row-major traversal.
- C) Column-major traversal.
- D) Recursive decomposition.
- E) Informal run-time analysis.

Answer: B

#### 10
If an $R \\times C$ 2D array is traversed row by row, and for each element a constant-time operation is performed, what is the informal execution count?

- A) $R + C$
- B) $R \\times C$
- C) $R^C$
- D) $2(R+
- C) $
- E) $R$

Answer: B
