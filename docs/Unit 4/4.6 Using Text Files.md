- A) while (scan.hasNext()) { String[] temp = scan.next().split("-"); usernames.add(temp[0].substring(0, 1) + temp[1]); }
- B) while (scan.hasNext()) { String[] temp = scan.next().split("-"); usernames.add(temp[1].substring(0, 1) + temp[0]); }
- C) while (scan.hasNext()) { String one = scan.next(); usernames.add(one.substring(0, 1) + one); }
- D) while (scan.hasNext()) { String[] temp = scan.next().split("-"); usernames.add(temp[1] + temp[0].substring(0, 1)); }
- E) while (scan.hasNext()) { usernames.add(scan.next().split("-")); }
