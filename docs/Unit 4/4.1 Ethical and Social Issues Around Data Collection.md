Answer: D

#### 3
Why might a hiring algorithm that uses a data set of past successful employees produce **biased predictions**?

- A) Old data sets are always too small to be statistically significant.
- B) Past human decisions may encode historical biases that the algorithm then repeats and reinforces.
- C) Sorting training data alphabetically removes all inherent bias from the set.
- D) Random shuffling of the data set deletes any systemic bias present in the collection.
- E) Bias in programs only stems from incorrect Java code, never from the data itself.

Answer: B

#### 4
What is the best immediate mitigation step after detecting unauthorized access to a database containing student records?

Answer: C

#### 5
A fitness tracking app shares raw heart-rate data with third-party advertisers. What is the primary **ethical issue** involved?

- A) The data are too noisy to be useful for any commercial purpose.
- B) Heart-rate data are already anonymized by default by the sensor hardware.
- C) Secondary use of sensitive health data without explicit consent violates user expectations.
- D) Heart-rate data are not considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- E) Advertisers are legally required to aggregate all data safely before use.

Answer: C

#### 6
A company's policy states that server logs are auto-deleted after 30 days. However, a developer keeps them for a year "just in case." What is the main risk?

- A) No risk exists if the servers have enough storage capacity.
- B) It violates the retention policy and expands the potential impact surface of a data breach.
- C) It only affects system performance and has no impact on user privacy.
- D) It improves model accuracy so it is considered an acceptable professional trade-off.
- E) Disk encryption removes all ethical and security risks associated with data retention.

Answer: B

#### 7
Why can simply "removing names" from a data set (de-identification) sometimes fail to protect user identity?

- A) The resulting file size stays too large for secure transmission.
- B) Quasi-identifiers like age, gender, and zip code can be linked to other public sets to re-identify individuals.
- C) Hashing algorithms always reveal the original identity through a simple reverse search.
- D) Only photographic data can be used to re-identify individuals in a large data set.
- E) Data without names are mathematically impossible to link to any other sources.

Answer: B

#### 8
A survey application only collects responses from "Premium" users about their satisfaction. What type of **bias** does this risk?

- A) No risk, because premium users represent the most important part of the user base.
- B) Sampling bias, as the results will skew toward high-activity users, making conclusions invalid for all users.
- C) Accuracy bias, because the fewer samples collected, the more accurate each individual sample is.
- D) No bias occurs as long as the questions themselves are written in an objective manner.
- E) Bias only occurs in offline physical data sets, not in digital survey applications.

Answer: B

#### 9
Which of the following is the most appropriate measure for protecting **sensitive data at rest**?

- A) Storing the data in plain text to allow for easier debugging.
- B) Using weak encryption methods to ensure there is no performance loss.
- C) Implementing strict access controls and encrypting the physical disk or specific files.
- D) Relying solely on a network firewall to prevent access to the physical storage device.
- E) Making multiple copies of the data on personal devices to ensure it is never lost.

Answer: C

#### 10
If a programmer collects email addresses for "notifications" but later wants to sell them to advertisers, how should they proceed?

- A) Sell the list immediately to maximize company revenue.

Answer: C
