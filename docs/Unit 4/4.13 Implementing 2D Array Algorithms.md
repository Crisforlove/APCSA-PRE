### Topic 4.13 — Implementing 2D Array Algorithms

#### 1
Consider the following code segment:
```java
int[][] arr2D = /* missing initialization */;
int sum = 0;
for (int j = 0; j < arr2D.length; j++) {
sum += arr2D[j][7];
}
```
Which initialization for arr2D will cause the code to print the value **3**?

- A) {{0, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 1}}
- B) {{0, 1, 2}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}
- C) {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 1}, {0, 0, 0}}
- D) {{0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0}}
- E) {{1, 1, 1}, {0, 0, 0}}

Answer: D

#### 2
What is the behavior of the following code segment which processes a 2D array arr?
```java
int ans = 1;
for (int[] row : arr) {
for (int value : row) {
if (value > 0) {
ans = ans * value;
}
}
}
```

- A) It prints the product of all elements in arr.
- B) It prints the product of all negative elements in arr.
- C) It prints the product of all positive elements in arr.
- D) It prints nothing because of a run-time error if zero is present.
- E) It prints the sum of all elements in the first row.

Answer: C

#### 3
The columnWithFewest(String target) method is intended to find the column index with the minimum occurrences of target. If sched has 3 rows and 5 columns and "busy" appears twice in column 1 and four times in all other columns, what does the method return?

- A) 0
- B) 1
- C) 2
- D) 3
- E) 4

Answer: B

#### 4
A square matrix mat is processed by an algorithm that swaps mat[i][j] with mat[SIZE-j-1][SIZE-i-1]. What is the visual result of this transformation?

- A) Reflection through the major diagonal.
- B) Reflection through the minor diagonal.
- C) Horizontal flip (symmetry).
- D) Vertical flip (symmetry).
- E) No change occurs.

Answer: B

#### 5
A method alter(mat, c) is intended to remove column c by shifting all subsequent columns one position to the left. Which change correctly fixes an implementation that currently does not shift the last column properly?

- A) Changing the loop bound to j < mat.length - 1.
- B) Changing the starting index to j = 0.
- C) Reversing the loop to traverse from right to left.
- D) Using an enhanced for loop for the columns.
- E) Making the matrix static.

Answer: A

#### 6
The method isThere(mat, 2, 2, "$") is designed to check for symbols. Which condition guarantees the method returns true?

- A) Only the element at [7] is "$".
- B) All elements in both diagonals are "$".
- C) All elements in column 2 are "$".
- D) The matrix is empty.
- E) The matrix size is $2 \\times 2$.

Answer: C

#### 7
When implementing an algorithm to find the **maximum value** in a 2D array, what should the max variable be initialized to for a robust result?

- A) 0
- B) Integer.MAX\_VALUE
- C) arr (the first element)
- D) The number of rows in the array.
- E) A random number from the Math class.

Answer: C

#### 8
An algorithm calculates the **average** of all elements in a designated row r. How many elements are used in the division?

- A) mat.length
- B) mat[r].length
- C) mat.size()
- D) r
- E) $R \\times C$

Answer: B

#### 9
To compute the sum of a specific **column** c in a 2D array, which traversal is most direct?

- A) Row-major order.
- B) Column-major order (iterating through rows while keeping column constant).
- C) Main diagonal traversal.
- D) Binary search of the row.
- E) Creating a copy of the row.

Answer: B

#### 10
In a 2D array algorithm intended to check for **duplicate** elements, what is the most common implementation approach?

- A) A single loop checking the first row.
- B) Nested loops comparing each element against all others or using a helper data structure.
- C) Sorting the first column only.
- D) Comparing the first element to the last element.
- E) Using the Math.abs() method on the length.

Answer: B
