#### 3
Which code segment will enable the method sum to compute $1 + 2 + ··· + n$ correctly for any $n > 0$?

- A) return n + sum(n - 1); (missing base case)
- B) if (n == 0) return 0; else return n + sum(n - 1);
- C) if (n == 1) return 1; else return n + sum(n - 1);
- D) Both B and C
- E) Neither A nor B

Answer: D

#### 4
When will method stringRecur terminate without error if it has **no base case** and always calls substring(1)?

- A) Only when length < 15
- B) Only when length >= 15
- C) Only when an empty string is input
- D) For all string inputs
- E) For no string inputs (Infinite recursion)

Answer: E

#### 5

- E) 2

Answer: B

#### 6

- D) $n$
- E) $n^2$

Answer: C

#### 7

Answer: A

#### 10
