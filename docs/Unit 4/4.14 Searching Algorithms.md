### Topic 4.14 — Searching Algorithms

#### 1
The decision to choose a particular searching algorithm (such as linear search vs. more complex ones) should be based on which of the following?

- I. Run-time efficiency
- II. Size of the data collection
- III. Memory requirements

- A) I only
- B) II only
- C) III only
- D) I and II only
- E) I, II, and III

Answer: E

#### 2
The following code fragment performs a sequential search for a value in array a. Which of the following should replace /* boolean expression */?
```java
int i = 0;
while (/* boolean expression */) { i++; }
```

- A) value != a[i]
- B) i < n && value == a[i]
- C) value != a[i] && i < n
- D) i < n && value != a[i]
- E) i < n || value != a[i]

Answer: D

#### 3
A feature of a data set that is required for a **Binary Search** but is NOT necessary for a **Sequential (Linear) Search** is:

- A) Length of the list.
- B) Type of the data stored.
- C) The order of the data (must be sorted).
- D) The presence of duplicate values.
- E) The use of object references instead of primitives.

Answer: C

#### 4
If a key is NOT present in an array a of length N, what happens during the execution of a linear search using `while (a[index] != key) index++;`?

- A) The loop returns -1 automatically.
- B) The program terminates successfully with a null value.
- C) A runtime ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs.
- D) The loop resets to index 0.
- E) The compiler reports a syntax error.

Answer: C

#### 5
A linear search algorithm can begin searching from:

- A) Only the beginning of the list.
- B) Only the end of the list.
- C) Either end of the array or ArrayList.
- D) Only the middle element.
- E) Only after the list is sorted alphabetically.

Answer: C

#### 6
When applying a linear search to a **2D array** to find a target value, what is the standard procedure?

- A) Search only the first and last rows.
- B) Search only the main diagonal.
- C) Access each row and then apply a linear search to each row.
- D) Flatten the 2D array into a 1D ArrayList first.
- E) Use a binary search on the columns regardless of sorting.

Answer: C

#### 7
An algorithm searches a sorted array for x by comparing every 3rd item to x. This is faster than a standard binary search when:

- A) x is in the middle.
- B) x is very close to the beginning of the array.
- C) x is not in the array.) The array is very large.
- E) It is never faster.

Answer: B

#### 8
What is the informal run-time complexity of a linear search in an array of $n$ elements in the **worst-case** (target not found)?

- A) Constant time.
- B) Linear time (proportional to $n$).
- C) Quadratic time.
- D) Logarithmic time.
- E) Exponential time.

Answer: B

#### 9
A search method includes a loop while (v[index] < key). Which of the following should be part of the **precondition** for this method to work?

- A) v is sorted from smallest to largest.
- B) v is sorted from largest to smallest.
- C) v contains no duplicates.
- D) key is definitely in v.
- E) v is a 2D array.

Answer: A

#### 10
Linear search is considered a **standard algorithm** in Unit 4. It works by:

- A) Repeatedly dividing the list in half.
- B) Checking each element in order until the value is found or the end is reached.
- C) Swapping the smallest element with the first element.
- D) Using a recursive merge process.
- E) Sorting the list and then picking the middle element.

Answer: B
