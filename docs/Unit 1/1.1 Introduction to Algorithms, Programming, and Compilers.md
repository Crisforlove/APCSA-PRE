### Topic 1.1 — Introduction to Algorithms, Programming, and Compilers

#### 1
Which of the following best describes the difference between a **syntax error** and a **logic error**?

- A) A syntax error is found by the programmer during testing, while a logic error is found by the compiler.
- B) A syntax error prevents the program from compiling, while a logic error allows the program to run but produces incorrect results.
- C) A syntax error occurs during the execution of the program, while a logic error occurs before the program starts.
- D) A logic error is always an ArithmeticException, while a syntax error is always a NullPointerException.
- E) There is no difference; both terms refer to the same type of programming mistake.

**Answer:** B

#### 2
A programmer is writing a program and forgets to include a semicolon at the end of a line. What will happen when the programmer attempts to compile and run the code?

- A) The program will run normally but ignore the line without the semicolon.
- B) The program will run and then throw a runtime exception when it reaches that line.
- C) The compiler will report a syntax error, and the program will not run.
- D) The computer will automatically insert the missing semicolon and run the program.
- E) The program will produce a logic error and output "null".

**Answer:** C

#### 3
Which of the following is an example of a **runtime error**?

- A) Missing a closing brace } in a class definition.
- B) Using a variable name that has not been declared.
- C) An attempt to divide an integer by zero while the program is executing.
- D) Writing a formula for the area of a square as side + side instead of side * side.
- E) Typing System.out.print as system.out.print (lowercase 's').

**Answer:** C

#### 4
Which of the following statements about **algorithms** is true?

- A) Algorithms can only be represented using Java code.
- B) An algorithm is a step-by-step process used to solve a problem or complete a task.
- C) Algorithms are only used for mathematical calculations.
- D) Every algorithm must contain at least one if statement and one while loop.
- E) Algorithms are executed by the compiler, not the computer's processor.

**Answer:** B

#### 5
A programmer wants to calculate the average of three numbers but writes the expression as a \+ b \+ c / 3.0 instead of (a \+ b \+ c) / 3.0. What type of error is this?

- A) Syntax error
- B) Logic error
- C) Runtime error
- D) Overflow error
- E) Rounding error

**Answer:** B

#### 6
What is the primary role of a **compiler** in the Java programming environment?

- A) To execute the program line by line and show the output.
- B) To allow the user to type in code and save it as a file.
- C) To check the code for syntax errors and translate it into a format the computer can execute.
- D) To automatically fix logic errors in the programmer's algorithms.
- E) To provide a graphical user interface for the application.

**Answer:** C

#### 7
Which of the following would be detected by a Java compiler?

- A) A variable name that is spelled differently than its declaration.
- B) A loop that never terminates (infinite loop).
- C) A calculation that results in a negative number when a positive was expected.
- D) A formula that uses the wrong mathematical operator.
- E) A user entering "abc" when the program expects an integer.

**Answer:** A

#### 8
What term describes a specific type of runtime error that interrupts the normal flow of a program’s execution?

- A) Logic flaw
- B) Syntax break
- C) Compilation warning
- D) Exception
- E) Algorithm drift

**Answer:** D

#### 9
In an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**, which tool is typically used to write the source code?

- A) The Compiler
- B) The Text Editor
- C) The Debugger
- D) The Virtual Machine
- E) The Output Console

**Answer:** B

#### 10
The order in which steps are completed in an algorithm is known as:

- A) Selection
- B) Iteration
- C) Sequencing
- D) Abstraction
- E) Encapsulation

**Answer:** C
