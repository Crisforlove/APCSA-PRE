### Topic 3.1 — Abstraction and Program Design

#### 1
Which of the following best describes the process of **abstraction** in program design?

- A) Writing as much code as possible in a single method.
- B) Hiding irrelevant details and focusing on the main idea to reduce complexity.
- C) Making all variables public so they can be accessed anywhere.
- D) Using only primitive data types to save memory.
- E) Avoiding the use of classes and objects.

Answer: B

#### 2
**Procedural abstraction** allows a programmer to use a method by:

- A) Knowing exactly how the method was written line-by-line.
- B) Knowing what the method does without needing to know how it is implemented.
- C) Only calling the method if it is static.
- D) Accessing the private instance variables of the class directly.
- E) Redefining the method in the main class.

Answer: B

#### 3
Breaking down a large behavior into smaller, manageable methods is called:

- A) Encapsulation
- B) Inheritance
- C) Method decomposition
- D) Instantiation
- E) Sequencing

Answer: C

#### 4
When designing a program using **top-down programming**, a programmer:

- A) Writes the lowest-level methods first.
- B) Writes the code from the first line to the last without planning.
- C) Defines operations to be performed and then refines them with more detail.
- D) Makes all methods private to start.
- E) Only uses recursion.

Answer: C

#### 5
Which of the following best demonstrates **modularity**?

- A) One method that handles input, processing, and output.
- B) Separate methods for input, processing, and output that are called by a main method.
- C) All code stored in global variables.
- D) Using one large if statement instead of multiple smaller ones.
- E) Avoiding helper methods to reduce overhead.

Answer: B

#### 6
What is a key benefit of **abstraction** for the user of a method?

- A) The user must read the method body to use it correctly.
- B) The user can rely on the method's purpose without knowing its implementation.
- C) The user must modify the method each time it is called.
- D) The user can bypass parameter type rules.
- E) The user can ignore return types.

Answer: B

#### 7
Which choice best describes **stepwise refinement**?

- A) Writing code without a plan.
- B) Starting with a high-level algorithm and gradually adding details.
- C) Removing comments from finished code.
- D) Replacing all loops with recursion.
- E) Adding more global variables to simplify access.

Answer: B

#### 8
Which of the following is an example of **code reuse** that supports abstraction?

- A) Duplicating the same logic in multiple methods.
- B) Calling a helper method from multiple places.
- C) Rewriting the same algorithm for each new class.
- D) Avoiding parameters to reduce complexity.
- E) Copying and pasting code without changes.

Answer: B

#### 9
Why is it useful to design methods with **parameters**?

- A) Parameters prevent a method from being tested.
- B) Parameters allow the same method to be used with different inputs.
- C) Parameters make a method private.
- D) Parameters avoid the need for return values.
- E) Parameters require all variables to be global.

Answer: B

#### 10
Which of the following best describes **encapsulation** in object-oriented design?

- A) The use of loops inside methods.
- B) Combining data and related behaviors into a class while limiting direct access.
- C) Using only static methods.
- D) Avoiding the use of constructors.
- E) Allowing any class to directly modify fields.

Answer: B
