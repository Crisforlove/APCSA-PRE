Which of the following variable declarations are most appropriate to replace /\* missing declarations \*/ in this code segment?
/\* missing declarations \*/
```java
circumference \= diameter \* 3.14159;
```
A) int diameter \= 1.5; int circumference;
B) int diameter \= 1; double circumference;
C) double diameter \= 1.5; double circumference;
D) double diameter \= 1.5; int circumference;
E) int diameter \= 1.5; double circumference;  

**Answer:** C

#### 2
Consider the following code segment.
```java
double d \= 20.5;
int i \= /\* missing code \*/;

A) I only
B) II only
C) I and II only
D) II and III only
E) I, II, and III  

**Answer:** C

#### 3
A code segment is intended to determine the number of players whose average score in a game exceeds 0.5.

A) int avgScore; int count;
B) int avgScore; double count;
C) double avgScore; int count;
D) double avgScore; double count;
E) boolean avgScore; int count;  

**Answer:** C

#### 4
The following code segment is intended to interchange the values of the int variables x and y. Assume that x and y have been properly declared and initialized.
```java
int temp \= x;
```

```java
y \= temp;
```
Which of the following can be used to replace /\* missing code \*/ so that the code segment works as intended?
A) x \= y;
B) y \= x;
C) temp \= y;
D) x \= temp;
E) y \= temp;  

**Answer:** A

#### 5
Consider the following code segment.
```java
double a \= 10.0;
double b \= 20.0;
double c \= a;
a \= b;
b \= c;
double d \= a;
```
What is the value of d after the code segment is executed?
A) 10.0
B) 14.0
C) 20.0
D) 20.5
E) 26.0  

**Answer:** C

#### 6
Consider the following code segment, where k and count are properly declared and initialized int variables.
```java
k \= 2;
```
/\* missing code \*/
```java
count \= count \+ k;
```
Which of the following best describes the behavior of the code segment if /\* missing code \*/ is empty?
A) The code segment leaves both k and count unchanged.
B) The code segment increases both k and count by 2.
C) The code segment increases k by 4 and count by 2.
D) The code segment leaves k unchanged and increases count by 2.
E) The code segment increases k by 2 and leaves count unchanged.  

**Answer:** D

#### 7
